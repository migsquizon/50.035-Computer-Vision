    "**Your answer:**  Regularization in machine learning is the process of regularizing the parameters that constrain, regularizes, or shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero. In other words, this technique discourages learning a more complex or flexible model, avoiding the risk of Overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as the regularization parameter - 𝜆 increases, the training accuracy falls and training accuracy increases. This is because it dynamically allows the model to not overfit with the test data and be general enough to predict test data. Also, after it reaches a specific large number of the parameter, the test accuracy also starts to fall. This is because  our model tries hard to minimize the weights without accurately minimizing the loss function.\n",
